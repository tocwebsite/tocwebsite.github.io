## Book

We follow the widely used textbook *Introduction to the Theory of Computation* by Michael Sipser. The book is available at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.in/Introduction-Theory-Computation-Michael-Sipser/dp/113318779X). As part of the lectures, we will also provide a list of problems that can be solved from this book as additional practice.

## Additional Course Materials

Students must read the following documents in the first week of class. These outline my expectations for the rest of the semester.

- [Taking Good Notes](http://svmiller.com/blog/2014/09/taking-good-notes/)
- [Fun with Attendance and Grades (i.e. Students Should Attend Class)](http://svmiller.com/blog/2016/05/fun-with-attendance-grades/)
